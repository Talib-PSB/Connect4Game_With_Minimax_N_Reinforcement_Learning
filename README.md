# Connect4Game_With_Minimax_N_Reinforcement_Learning
A simple old school game incorporating AI subsets.
The aim of this project is to illustrate the core fundamentals of AI algorithms such as Depth First Search, (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS) and Minimax with alpha-beta pruning that is to be use in 2 player games creation. 
For example, Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory. It is use to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. 
The objective of this algorithm, is to reduce the chances of the opponent winning the game. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, poker, chess and connect4 that will be illustrated in this miniproject.
In this Miniproject, Minimax and reinforce learning will be use to provide artificial intelligence to the computer playing the connect 4 game.
